                        I have spent a lot of time in my life trying to figure out exactly where I belong and the truth of the matter is that to this day I still can't figure out why that is. A good part of me believes it is because I have always been reminded that I am not supposed to belong. Whether it was my peers at my mainly white prep school or even my contemporaries at my Ivy League college, I never truly felt as though I belonged. Being a young boy in New York, I didn't feel different. I was surrounded by people that looked like me and thought like me. We all ran from the police because we all knew someone in jail, or that had been shot. I was raised by people who wanted better for me, but that mentality is not as common where I'm from. I would love to make the problems black and brown folks go away, but like the laws put in place to oppress us, it will take years to correct. I want to thank you for reading and perhaps even empathizing, hopefully you can get into the mind of a people displaced and outcast. I don't need your sympathy because I am an always will be unabashedly black.</p>
